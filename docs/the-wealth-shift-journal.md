📖 Introduction to Workbook 1: Rewiring Your Money Mindset & Building Confidence
Before we talk about debt, investing, or creating wealth,
we have to start with the most powerful asset we have—our mindset.
Because no matter how much you earn, save, or plan...
If your mind is still stuck in fear, shame, or self-doubt—
you’ll never feel free.
You’ll never feel safe around money.
And I know this because I’ve lived it.
At 33, I had just $2,000 to my name.
I was a single mom—tired, overwhelmed, and feeling like I had started too late.
I believed wealth was for “other people.”
I thought discipline belonged to people who had more time, more support, more everything.
But one day, I challenged myself to try.
To learn.
To save a little.
To believe that maybe—just maybe—I could be good with money.
That year, I made a quiet but powerful decision:
“From now on, I will pay myself first—every single month.”
I wasn’t earning six figures. I wasn’t debt-free.
But I started anyway.
And by the end of that year, my savings had grown from just over $12,000 to $50,000 — all while earning about $60,000/yr.
It wasn’t magic.
It wasn’t luck.
It was clarity.
It was consistency.
It was self-respect in action.
To show you just how real this journey was, I’m sharing the actual spreadsheet I used to track my progress month by month:
________________________________________

📸 MY PAY MYSELF FIRST SPREADSHEET – 2020
 
💡 Real Numbers. Real Progress.
This spreadsheet shows exactly how I broke my savings into buckets, tracked growth, and stayed consistent. I started small. I stayed committed. And this is what happened.
📌 Note from Beryl
This screenshot is real.
Real effort. Real growth. Real mindset shift.
I’ll break it all down—how I invested, bought a home, and walked away with over $100K in profit—in a later workbook on Investing & Growing Your Wealth.
But it all started here.
One decision. One mindset shift. One step at a time.
Stick with this. You’re building something powerful.
I’m proud of you already.

💬 “This wasn’t about being perfect—it was about showing up for myself every month.”
This was the beginning of my Wealth Shift.
And now it’s your turn.
________________________________________
🌱 This isn’t about money first.
This is about mindset.
This is about identity.
This is about you discovering what’s been holding you back—so you can finally let it go.
You’re not here because you don’t care about money.
You’re here because you care enough to finally face the truth.
To get curious.
To shift.
This workbook will walk you through 7 transformational lessons designed to help you:
•	Identify and release limiting money beliefs
•	Build financial confidence from the inside out
•	Reflect on your past without shame—and choose a new future
•	Discover what financial independence really means to you
•	Start thinking like a wealthy woman—before the money even shows up
________________________________________
✨ If you show up for this work—even 15 minutes a day—you’ll start to feel the shift.
Because wealth isn’t something you chase.
It’s something you align with.
And it all starts with how you think, feel, and speak about money.

📖 The Wealth Shift Workbook 1
Day One: The Wealth Shift Begins in Your Mind
🧠 Your Mindset, Your Family Beliefs, and the Legacy You’re About to Break
________________________________________
💬 Welcome Message:
Before we talk about budgets, debt, or income…
We have to start with the only thing that controls every decision you’ve ever made about money:
Your mindset.
"Becoming is better than being." – Carol Dweck
In her book Mindset: The New Psychology of Success, psychologist Carol Dweck reveals a truth that changed the way the world thinks about potential:
You’re not born smart or successful.
You become smart and successful—when you believe growth is possible.
This applies to your career.
Your relationships.
Your personal goals.
And especially to your finances.
But your mindset didn’t begin with you.
Maybe no one sat you down and said, “Here’s how to think about money.”
But you learned anyway.
You watched. You absorbed. You copied.
What your parents said.
What they didn’t say.
What you saw.
And what you silently decided from your earliest memories.
Now, without even realizing it, you may be living by those same silent rules.
But today, you get to wake up—and choose different.
________________________________________


🧠 Part 1: What Is a Mindset—And Why Does It Shape Your Wealth?
A mindset is the set of beliefs you hold about yourself and the world.
It influences how you think, feel, and act especially in the face of difficulty.
Your mindset is like your brain’s operating system. It decides:
•	Whether you believe change is possible
•	Whether you see mistakes as failure or feedback
•	Whether you act from fear or from power
Your mindset doesn’t just affect your confidence.
It directly shapes your relationship with money.
________________________________________
🌱 The Two Mindsets: Fixed vs. Growth
🔒 Fixed Mindset
A fixed mindset believes that your intelligence, abilities, or financial status are set in stone.
People with a fixed mindset often think:
•	“I’m just not good at this.”
•	“If I fail, it means I’ll never get it.”
•	“Other people succeed because they’re lucky or naturally smart.”
In money terms, a fixed mindset sounds like:
•	“I’ll always be behind.”
•	“I was never taught how to manage money—so I never will.”
•	“Wealthy people are just born that way.”
•	“I’ve messed up too much to fix it now.”
🧱 Fixed mindsets lead to avoidance, shame, and staying stuck.
You don’t try—because you believe your financial story is already written.
🔓 Growth Mindset
A growth mindset believes that with effort, learning, and persistence—you can get better at anything.
People with a growth mindset say things like:
•	“I don’t understand this yet, but I will.”
•	“Setbacks teach me something valuable.”
•	“I trust the process. I can improve.”
In finances, this sounds like:
•	“I wasn’t taught, but I’m capable of learning.”
•	“It’s okay to be a beginner.”
•	“Each decision I make is a step toward wealth.”
•	“I can break the cycle and create a new legacy.”
🌱 A growth mindset opens the door to financial peace and power.
You stop hiding—and start healing, learning, and building wealth on purpose.
💡 The Wealth Shift Principle:
Wealth doesn’t begin with your income.
Wealth begins in your mind.
You don’t need to be perfect—just willing to grow.
________________________________________
💸 Part 2: What You Learned About Money (Without Even Realizing)
Your current beliefs didn’t come from nowhere.
You inherited many of them—from your parents, your culture, your environment, and even silence.
Let’s uncover the money messages you were raised with—and choose what stays and what goes.
✍️ Exercise 1: What Was the Financial Atmosphere in Your Home?
Fill in the blanks:
•	Growing up, money in my house felt: ____________________________
•	My parents (or caregivers) taught me that money was: ____________________________
•	I often heard phrases like:
⬜ “We can’t afford that.”
⬜ “Money doesn’t grow on trees.”
⬜ “Rich people are greedy.”
⬜ “You have to work hard for every dollar.”
⬜ “As long as the bills are paid, we’re fine.”
⬜ “You better marry someone who has money.”
⬜ Other: ____________________________
✍️ Exercise 2: What Beliefs Did You Pick Up?
Check any that shaped your younger self—positive or negative. Be honest, not judgmental.
🧱 Limiting Beliefs:
⬜ “Money is stressful and unpredictable.”
⬜ “People like me will never be wealthy.”
⬜ “Talking about money causes conflict.”
⬜ “I have to work 10x harder just to get ahead.”
⬜ “If I make more, I’ll lose it anyway.”
⬜ “Debt is normal—everyone has it.”
⬜ “If I want something nice, I should feel guilty.”
⬜ “It’s selfish to want more money.”
⬜ “I’m bad with money and always will be.”
⬜ “Only people with connections or privilege succeed.”
🌱 Empowering Beliefs:
⬜ “I can always figure things out.”
⬜ “Money can be a tool for freedom and joy.”
⬜ “I may not know everything, but I’m open to learning.”
⬜ “Saving even a little matters.”
⬜ “Hard work and smart choices create opportunity.”
⬜ “It’s okay to want more—as long as I stay aligned with my values.”
⬜ “I deserve peace and security around money.”
⬜ “Wealth is something I can grow into.”
⬜ “I’m capable of breaking generational cycles.”
⬜ “I don’t have to do it alone—community and knowledge are part of wealth.”
💡 Reflection tip:
Which of your beliefs feel like hand-me-downs?
Which ones do you want to keep, nurture, or pass on?
________________________________________
🔄 Part 3: Rewrite the Rules – With a Growth Mindset
💌 Note from Beryl:
When I did this exercise for myself, I started by writing down every old belief I had about money—no matter how small, silly, or painful it felt.
That part came easy.
But creating new, empowering beliefs? That was harder.
So I asked ChatGPT to help me.
I gave it my list of limiting beliefs—and it helped me rewrite each one into something hopeful, strong, and full of growth.
The rewired beliefs became the foundation for my daily affirmations—and now, my mindset is one of my greatest assets.
Now it’s your turn.
✍️ Rewire Table – From Limiting to Empowering
Old Belief	New Empowering Belief
"I’m bad with money."	"I’m learning every day, and that makes me powerful."
"People like me never build wealth."	"I am capable of building a legacy that changes everything."
"I’m too far behind to catch up."	"I am starting exactly where I need to—and I’m moving forward."
"I always mess up with money."	"I learn from every mistake and grow stronger each time."
Your turn: ______________________	_________________________________
💡 Pro tip: If you feel stuck, ask ChatGPT:
“Help me reframe this belief: [insert your limiting belief].”
________________________________________
💬 My Story: The Belief That Almost Kept Me Broke
I used to believe I’d always be behind.
At 33, as a single mom with a net worth of $2,000, I told myself:
•	“I’m not good with money.”
•	“People like me don’t build wealth.”
•	“It’s too late to start over.”
But those weren’t facts.
They were fears—inherited from what I saw, not what I was truly capable of.
Letting go of that belief wasn’t just freeing.
It was necessary.
The moment I released the lie that I’d never catch up, I found space to create something entirely new.
And you can too.
________________________________________
📝 Day 1-Reflection Prompt:
What’s one money belief I’ve carried that no longer serves me—and how has it shaped the way I’ve been living?
💡 Example from Beryl:
"One of the beliefs I carried for years was: 'I’ll always be behind financially.'
That belief made me play small. It made me settle. It kept me from investing, asking questions, or believing I was capable of building something new.But once I realized it was just a belief not a fact. I replaced it with: 'I am capable of catching up and creating a legacy beyond anything I was handed.' That one shift changed everything."

💬 Welcome to Day Two: Choosing Empowerment & Celebrating Progress.
💡 You don’t just change your beliefs. You choose them.
Day 1 – Quick Recap
Yesterday, you explored how your mindset shapes your financial life. You uncovered the money beliefs you inherited and began the process of rewriting them with intention. Your past doesn’t define your wealth, your beliefs and actions do.
________________________________________
Letting go of a limiting belief is a powerful first step—
but release without replacement leaves space for doubt to creep back in.
This is why today’s shift matters.
It’s not just about deleting the old story—it’s about writing a new one.
When we’re unlearning, we’re often standing in a void.
It can feel unfamiliar, even scary.
You’ve just uprooted something that shaped how you thought, felt, and acted for years.
But here’s the beautiful truth:
That space you’ve created? That’s the birthplace of possibility.
This is your invitation to step into an empowering belief:
✨ One that makes you feel grounded.
✨ One that supports your growth.
✨ One that aligns with the future you’re building.
You don’t have to believe it 100% yet.
You just have to begin trying it on—like a new outfit.
Wear it. Walk around in it. Speak it aloud.
At first, it might feel awkward. But with practice, it becomes your truth.
🧠 Mindset Reminder:
Every time you choose a new belief, you’re practicing a growth mindset.
It’s not just about what you believe—it’s about who you’re becoming through what you believe.
A fixed mindset holds onto fear, guilt, and inherited stories.
A growth mindset says: “I’m allowed to evolve.”
And that’s exactly what you’re doing here.
________________________________________
🔄 The process:
1.	Identify a belief that supports who you’re becoming (even if it feels like a stretch).
2.	Write it down. Post it somewhere you’ll see it.
3.	Say it out loud every morning or every time doubt creeps in.
4.	Catch yourself when you’re tempted to revert to the old belief—and gently choose again.
________________________________________
🌱 The benefit:
Shifting your belief system is the foundation for every financial and life transformation.
You move from surviving to building. From reacting to creating. From scarcity to expansion. You don’t have to keep believing what you were taught. You don’t have to live out your parents’ money story. You don’t have to carry shame, fear, or silence around money anymore.
You can choose new beliefs that serve the version of you you're becoming.
________________________________________
💬 From My Story:
When I let go of the belief that I was doomed to always be behind, I had to fill that space with something new.
Something that would support the woman I was becoming.
I didn’t need a perfect plan or instant transformation.
I just needed a belief that felt possible—and powerful.
So, I began telling myself:
“I am building something that matters.”
“I am learning. I am growing. And I am getting better with money every day.
This belief wasn’t loud, but it was steady.
And the more I said it, the more I believed it.
What about you?
It doesn’t need to sound impressive to anyone else.
It just needs to feel good in your body.
________________________________________
 🌿 Try this shift:
“I’m stuck” → “I’m becoming someone I’m proud of.”
“I’ll never catch up.” → “I am building my future one aligned choice at a time.”
________________________________________
What’s a Money Win You’re Proud Of?
Let’s be honest—most of us are really good at downplaying our progress.
We shrug off our small wins. We think, “It’s not a big deal,”
or “I should be further by now.”
But the truth?
Every shift starts small.
Every empowered decision you’ve made—no matter how quiet—deserves to be honored.
Maybe you finally said “no” to something that used to throw off your budget.
Maybe you chose to pause before swiping your card.
Maybe you opened a savings account, tracked your expenses, or paid more than the minimum… just once.
None of these actions are small.
Because behind every one of them is something bigger:
🌱 Discipline.
🌱 Self-respect.
🌱 Belief in your future.
________________________________________
💡 Why this matters:
Wealth doesn’t begin with a bank balance.
It begins with a decision—then another, and another.
And those decisions stack.
They build new patterns. They teach your nervous system that you're safe, capable, and in control.
________________________________________
🔄 The process:
1.	Look back at the moments you showed up for your money.
2.	Name it clearly. Describe the moment and how it felt.
3.	Celebrate it. Literally say to yourself: “I’m proud of this. I did this.”
This isn’t about ego. It’s about building self-trust.
________________________________________
🌟 The benefit:
When you acknowledge your wins—no matter how small—you begin to rewrite your identity.
You stop seeing yourself as someone who’s “bad with money”…
…and start becoming the kind of woman who shows up for herself.
That self-recognition fuels momentum.
And that momentum?
It’s what turns a $25 savings win into a $25,000 net worth shift.
________________________________________
💬 From My Story:
When I created my “Pay Yourself First” plan and stuck with it—even for just one month—it changed how I saw myself.
I remember the first time I followed through with saving at the beginning of the month instead of waiting to see what was left at the end. It felt small. No one knew about it but me. But that moment—it changed everything.
That quiet, intentional decision became a turning point.
It wasn’t about the amount—it was about the act.
It taught me that I could trust myself with money.
And I didn’t save thousands overnight.
But I saved something.
And that “something” became the foundation of a net worth I never imagined I’d build.
🌿 Quiet progress is still progress.
🌿 You are not starting from scratch—you are starting from experience.
🌿 And every step counts.
 🌿 Try this shift:
“I’m not doing enough.” → “Every step I take is creating the life I want.”
“I’ll never catch up.” → “I am building my future one aligned choice at a time.”
Now head into your reflection with your shoulders a little higher—you’ve earned it. 💫

📖 Welcome to Day Three: 🔥 Let’s Be Honest: Do You Really Want Financial Independence?
💡 Desire alone is not enough. Your mindset must believe it’s possible.
Day 2 – Quick Recap
You realized that mindset isn’t just inherited, it’s chosen. You practiced replacing old beliefs with new empowering ones and celebrated the money wins that prove you're already growing. Small steps aren’t small when they shift your identity. You are becoming her.
________________________________________
We all say we want financial freedom.
It’s one of the most repeated phrases in personal development:
“I want to be financially independent.”
But here’s what I’ve come to realize:
Most people don’t actually believe it’s possible for them.
They say it like a wish, not a plan.
They treat it like a dream on the shelf—beautiful to look at but never touched.
And I get it.
Because we were raised to survive, not to thrive.
To make ends meet, not to build wealth.
To settle, not to soar.
But if you’ve made it this far in the workbook, I need you to hear me:
Financial independence is not just for “other people.” It’s for YOU.
Yes, you—with your past, your doubts, your messy finances.
You—with the kids, the aging parents, the paycheck-to-paycheck stress.
You—with your incredible resilience and your quiet strength.
You were born with the power to shift your story.
________________________________________


💡 So What Is Financial Independence?
Financial independence means you no longer rely on a paycheck to survive—because your income, investments, or assets cover your lifestyle.
It doesn’t always mean being “rich.”
It means having choices.
It means living on your terms, not fear.
It means the ability to walk away from anything that isn’t aligned—and to say “yes” to things that are, without asking permission.
It’s not just about money. It’s about freedom, power, peace, and self-trust.
🧠 Mindset Check:
A fixed mindset says:
“That’s for people smarter, richer, or luckier than me.”
A growth mindset says:
“I don’t know how yet, but I can learn. I can grow. I can create that for myself.”
One keeps you trapped in survival.
The other unlocks freedom—through discipline, learning, and belief.
💥 If you don’t believe financial freedom is available to you, you’ll never move toward it.
This isn’t just a numbers game. It’s a mindset game.
________________________________________
✨ Stop Saying It Like It’s a Dream—Say It Like It’s a Decision
If you truly want financial freedom, don’t just wish for it—plan for it.
Wake up from the fantasy and step into the reality of your own power.
Too many women say they want it…
…but they’ve never sat down to define what it looks like.
They’ve never calculated what it would cost.
They’ve never created a plan.
They’re just hoping something will change someday.
But someday is not a strategy.
If you’re not willing to put in the work to build it, then be honest with yourself.
Because saying you want something and not acting on it?
That’s emotional clutter.
That’s avoidance dressed up as ambition.
And you are too powerful to lie to yourself like that.
________________________________________
💬 From My Story:
At first, I thought financial independence was about hitting a savings number.
But when I really sat with it, I realized what I wanted was peace.
The ability to walk away from anything that wasn’t aligned.
To say “no” without guilt and “yes” without fear.
To breathe.
As a single mom, I used to carry the fear of “what if.”
•	What if the car breaks down?
•	What if the money runs out?
•	What if I can’t provide?
That fear was constant. Quiet. Heavy.
And I believed the only way out was to save enough to escape it all.
But today, looking back, I realized something powerful:
I became financially free the day I created and committed myself to the Pay Yourself First Plan.
It wasn’t when I hit six figures.
It wasn’t when I paid off a credit card.
It was when I sat down, looked at my money honestly, and said:
“From this day forward, I choose me.”
That plan taught me discipline.
It taught me to prioritize my future self.
It reminded me that wealth isn’t a number—it’s a commitment to honor your value every single month.
I didn’t wait until I was debt-free to feel empowered.
I didn’t wait for a big raise to take my money seriously.
I simply decided to stop putting myself last.
And that decision?
That was the beginning of my true financial freedom.
🌿 Your version of freedom matters. Honor it.
🌿 Try this shift: 
“I want more money.” → “I want freedom, peace, and power—and money will help me create it.”

📝 Day 3- Reflection Prompt:
What would financial freedom truly look like for you?
•	What does it feel like in your body?
•	What does your day look like?
•	Who do you become when you’re no longer afraid of money?

📖 Welcome to Day Four: If Money Wasn’t a Factor, What Would You Be Doing?
💡 You don’t need millions to live a meaningful life—just permission from yourself.
Day 3 – Quick Recap
You explored what financial freedom really means to you. Not just a number—but a feeling. A mindset. A decision. Real freedom begins the moment you stop waiting and start acting like it’s already yours.
________________________________________
💬 Today’s Reflection: What Would You Do If Money Weren’t in the Way?
Let’s go deeper.
Let’s remove every limitation you’ve internalized.
Let’s strip away the fear… the what-ifs… the guilt and responsibility that whisper:
“You have to suffer now to earn your joy later.”
Because here’s the truth most women were never told:
💥 You don’t have to wait to feel free.
💥 You don’t need permission to pursue joy.
💥 You don’t need millions to live a meaningful, fulfilling life.
So let’s ask a question that might unlock something sacred inside you:
If money wasn’t a factor—what would you be doing with your life?
Would you write?
Start a business?
Work fewer hours and spend more time with your children?
Move to a slower, more soulful place?
Give back to your community in a way that lights you up?



🎯 This Isn’t About Fantasy—It’s About Truth
This isn’t about fairy tales.It’s about reconnecting with the version of you that existed before money taught you to play small.
Before the debt.
Before the pressure.
Before survival became your identity.
This question invites your growth mindset to wake up—and start dreaming with strategy.
It’s about remembering: You are allowed to live with joy.
________________________________________
💬 From My Story:
This was one of the most powerful turning points for me.
I used to believe I had to "arrive" at financial freedom before I could do meaningful work.
I thought I had to save X amount… have Y credentials… or get to some magical moment where everything felt “safe.”
But that moment never came—because I was waiting for permission to live.
It wasn’t until I asked myself this exact question that something shifted:
If money wasn’t in the way, what would I be doing right now?
The answer was clear:
💬 I’d be helping women talk about money, rewrite their stories, and reclaim their power.
That’s what sparked The Wealth Shift.
And the wildest thing?
Once I started walking in that purpose, everything changed.
✨ Money started to follow me.
✨ Opportunities showed up.
✨ Clarity showed up.
✨ Confidence grew.
All because I stopped waiting—and started living like I was already free.
💡 Mindset shift: I didn’t wait for freedom to come. I created it—one bold belief and one tiny action at a time.

📖 Welcome to Day Five: What Are You Good At That Others Value?
Day 4– Quick Recap
Yesterday, you dreamed without limits. You dared to ask, what would I do if money weren’t a factor? Today, we bring that vision down to earth with a mindset-shifting truth:

✨ The truth that your dream isn’t as far off as you think—because the tools to build it already live inside you.
You have something—right now—that others admire, need, or benefit from.
But because it comes easily to you, you might be overlooking it.
You have something—right now—that people admire, need, and benefit from.
But because it comes easily to you, you’ve likely been overlooking it.
We’ve been taught to downplay what’s natural to us.
To shrink our gifts unless they come with a title, a paycheck, or a degree.
To believe that value only comes from what’s “official” or loud or profitable.
But here’s the truth:
🌟 Your gift—yes, the one you take for granted—might be the key to your financial breakthrough.
💬 Maybe people always come to you for advice.
💬 Maybe you're the one who keeps everyone grounded.
💬 Maybe you have an eye for beauty, a way with words, or a calming energy that shifts rooms.
What feels ordinary to you might be extraordinary to someone else.
🧠 Mindset Check:
A fixed mindset says:
“If it’s easy for me, it must not be worth much.”
A growth mindset says:
“If it’s easy for me, that’s a sign it’s my zone of genius.”

________________________________________
💬 From My Story:
For years, I didn’t realize that my passion for talking about money—and making it feel simple and safe—was a gift.
It came so naturally that I assumed everyone thought this way.
But they didn’t.
When women came to me with questions and left feeling hopeful and empowered, I knew I had something.
It wasn’t about being a financial expert.
It was about being a guide. A mirror. A sister.
Once I owned that? I stopped hiding—and started building.
And that’s when everything changed.
💡 Growth begins the moment you stop underestimating what you carry.

📍 How Long Do You Think It Will Take to Get There?
Let’s talk about how long you think it will take to create the life you dream about—not the pressured, rushed version, but the one that feels doable, exciting, and real.
When I finally mapped it out, I realized… I was closer than I thought.
No, I didn’t have all the answers.
But I had something better: direction.
And direction turns a dream into a plan.
🌿 You don’t have to know how it’ll all work. You just need to name where you’re headed.
📝 Reflection Prompt:
If I gave myself permission to dream—and plan—what kind of timeline would feel exciting and achievable?

📍 Could It Become Income in a Small Way?
This is where we break the myth that you need a brand, a business plan, or a big launch to earn from what you love.
🌱 The Wealth Shift began with one worksheet. One conversation. That’s it. That’s it.
I didn’t wait for perfection.
I just started sharing what I knew—with one woman. Then another. Then another.
And something beautiful happened:
My gift made room for me.

📍 What’s One Step You Could Take This Week?
I started by inviting six women to a money circle.
It wasn’t fancy.
There was no website. No funnel. No plan beyond starting.
But it gave me clarity, confidence, and confirmation that I was on the right path.

📍 What’s One Fear Holding You Back—and How Will You Move Through It?
Let’s name the thing standing quietly between you and your next move.
For me? It was the fear of being seen.
What if I failed?
What if people talked?
What if I wasn’t ready?
But I chose to move anyway.
Because this isn’t just about me—it’s about creating freedom for the woman I used to be…
and the women watching me now.
🌿 Fear doesn’t need to disappear for you to rise. You just have to choose who’s driving.

📖 Welcome to Day Six: What’s One Aligned Action You Can Take This Week?
💡 Wishing creates hope. Action creates transformation.
Day 5 – Quick Recap
You explored your natural gifts. You honored your path. You named your fears and dared to believe that what you have is enough to begin.
Now it’s time to bridge the gap between who you believe you are…
and how you show up in the world.
________________________________________
💬 Welcome to Day Six: From Inner Shift to Aligned Action
You’ve done the inner work. You’ve reflected, questioned, and challenged yourself.
Now… it’s time to move.
Not with pressure.
Not with overwhelm.
But with intention.
✨You don’t need to build the whole bridge today.
You just need to take the next step.
This is the moment that separates wishing from becoming.
________________________________________
📍 A Word on Self-Sacrifice
Let’s get honest.
Too many women delay their dreams in the name of service.
They say:
•	“Now’s not the time.”
•	“The kids need me.”
•	“Let me just take care of everyone else first…”
But here’s the truth:
🌿 Self-sacrifice without boundaries is self-erasure.
It costs you time.
It costs you vision.
It costs you joy.
And eventually, it costs your purpose.
We’ve been conditioned to believe that putting ourselves last is noble.
But real leadership—real love—starts with example.
And the best example you can give your family is this:
💥 A woman who honors herself.
That means making space for your voice.
That means saying yes to one small step toward your future.
That means choosing growth even when it’s inconvenient.
________________________________________
💬 From My Story:
I started by inviting six women to talk about money.
No brand. No fancy presentation.
Just an idea, a space, and a desire to share.
That single action birthed The Wealth Shift.
Not because it was perfect—
But because it was true.
And every time I followed up, spoke up, or showed up—I gained more:
•	More clarity
•	More courage
•	More momentum
But what I don’t often say is this:
That moment required me to choose myself for the first time in a long time.
For years, I believed being a good woman, wife, or mother meant putting myself last.
I wore self-sacrifice like a badge of honor—until I realized it was costing me my voice, my purpose, and my peace.
Starting The Wealth Shift meant honoring me.
My dreams. My talents. My desire to make a difference.
And once I made that choice, everything changed.
✨ Taking action silenced my fear.
✨ Choosing myself gave me back my power.
✨ I am no longer stuck. I am a woman who moves.________________________________________
🧠 Mindset Check:
A fixed mindset says:
“I can’t start until I have it all figured out.”
A growth mindset says:
“I can start with what I have—and that’s enough.”

🌿 Try this shift::
“I don’t know where to start.” → “I’ll start with one thing—and that’s enough.”

📖 Day 7: The Truth About Self-Discipline, Self-Honor & Accountability
Quick Recap:
You took one aligned step. You honored your voice. You chose yourself. But now let’s tell the truth. Because all the mindset shifts in the world don’t matter if you don’t follow through.
________________________________________
💬 The Truth About Self-Discipline, Self-Honor & Accountability
Most people won’t tell you this part.
Because it’s not sexy.
Because it sounds hard.
Because it puts the responsibility back in your hands.
But here’s the truth:
You cannot build wealth if you keep abandoning yourself.
It’s not the budget.
It’s not the income.
It’s not even the debt.
It’s the moment you:
•	Stop negotiating with your excuses
•	Stop breaking promises to yourself
•	Stop waiting for the perfect time, income, or mindset
That’s the moment everything changes.
This is where wealth actually begins.
Not in your bank account—
But in your ability to honor your own word.
To lead yourself.
To be who you said you would be.
________________________________________


💬 From My Story:
I didn’t create this workbook because I had it all figured out.
I created it to share what I’d learned—what I was still learning—about money and mindset.
But something unexpected happened along the way.
As I wrote it, I decided to live it.
To actually apply every lesson.
To embody what I was asking other women to do.
And that decision?
It changed everything.
I realized my financial struggles weren’t about a lack of knowledge.
They were about:
•	Lack of self-discipline
•	Lack of self-honor
•	Lack of accountability
When I looked in the mirror and got radically honest, I saw it:
I was the one getting in my own way.
I ignored my numbers.
I spent from emotion.
I kept saying, “I’ll do better next month.”
Not because I didn’t know better—
But because I wasn’t choosing myself.
In 2020, I made a different choice.
I honored my word.
I built systems. I created boundaries. I stopped buying out of impulse.
I showed up for my body. I moved. I ate well. I prayed. I reflected.
I stopped outsourcing my peace.
And the more I honored myself, the easier it became to build everything else.

🔁 A Sacred Reminder: The Manifesto You Already Signed
Before you even began this workbook, you said yes to something big.
You signed the Wealth Shift Manifesto—
A personal declaration that you would stop abandoning yourself.
That you would rise. That you would lead yourself. That you would act.
You didn’t do that by accident.
You did that because some part of you knows this is your time.
Because some part of you is done settling for survival.
Because you’re ready to lead your life—not just wish for a better one.
🗝️ That manifesto wasn’t just a formality.
It was your first act of self-honor.
And every step you’ve taken in this workbook has been a reflection of that powerful decision.
💡 Why It Matters:
When you honor your word to yourself, everything changes:
•	You trust yourself more.
•	You follow through more.
•	You stop chasing quick fixes and start building real wealth.
That’s the benefit of self-discipline.
That’s the beauty of self-honor.
That’s the power of radical accountability.
You don’t need more motivation. You need to keep your promise.
And you already did the hardest part: You made it. You started.
So let this be your reminder—
You are the shift.
You are no longer the woman who starts and stops.
You are the woman who follows through.

💡 Final Shift Challenge:
Discipline isn’t about restriction—it’s about freedom.
And freedom comes when your words and your actions align.
So this week, your challenge is this:
✨ Pick ONE thing to commit to.
✨ Write it down.
✨ Do it.
✨ And then do it again.
✨ Prove to yourself that you can be trusted.

💬 Final Word from Me
I know what it’s like to feel behind, overwhelmed, or unsure.
At 33, I was a single mom with just $2,000 to my name—tired, burned out, and afraid I’d started too late.
But something inside me refused to give up.
So I did the scariest, most powerful thing I could do:
I chose myself.
This mindset shift—this very work you’ve just completed—is what helped me go from surviving to building a clear, confident path to financial freedom. Not just on paper, but in my spirit. Because beyond the numbers, I got something more valuable back: peace.
I stopped avoiding my money.
I stopped shrinking around it.
And I started facing it—with compassion, curiosity, and clarity.
Then came the next step: action.
I sat down with my numbers and asked,
“What am I paying myself?”
“Where is my money actually going?”
“Am I building a future—or just funding everyone else’s?”
That was the moment everything changed.
I realized that with some small shifts—even temporary ones—I could create a real, sustainable plan. One that allowed me to get out of debt, start investing, and build a future I didn’t have to escape from.
That’s how my Pay Yourself Plan was born. Now, I want to share it with you.
