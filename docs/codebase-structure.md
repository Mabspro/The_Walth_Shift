Why This Approach Wins:
1. Seamless User Experience

Unified progress tracking across all 6 workbooks
Single login/authentication system
Consistent UI/UX throughout the journey
Cross-workbook analytics (e.g., "You've completed 2 of 6 workbooks")

2. Business Model Flexibility

Progressive unlocking (complete Workbook 1 to access Workbook 2)
Bundle pricing vs individual workbook sales
Subscription model compatibility
Easier upselling between workbooks

3. Technical Advantages

Shared user data and preferences
Unified dashboard showing overall progress
Consistent design system and components
Single deployment pipeline

Implementation Strategy:
Modular Development Approach
javascript// Each workbook as a self-contained module
const workbooks = {
  'mindset': () => import('./workbooks/workbook-1-mindset'),
  'debt': () => import('./workbooks/workbook-2-debt'),
  'investing': () => import('./workbooks/workbook-3-investing'),
}

// Dynamic loading based on user access
const WorkbookRouter = ({ workbookId }) => {
  const WorkbookComponent = lazy(workbooks[workbookId])
  return <WorkbookComponent />
}
Database Schema Example
sql-- User progress across all workbooks
user_progress (
  user_id,
  workbook_id,
  day_completed,
  completion_percentage,
  last_accessed
)

-- Individual workbook responses
workbook_responses (
  user_id,
  workbook_id,
  day_id,
  question_id,
  response_text,
  created_at
)
Development Benefits:
1. Team Efficiency

Parallel development of different workbooks
Shared component library (progress bars, reflection prompts, etc.)
Consistent code standards across all workbooks
Single testing framework

2. Maintenance Advantages

Centralized bug fixes and security updates
Unified analytics and user behavior tracking
Single hosting/deployment infrastructure
Easier A/B testing across workbooks

When to Consider Separate Apps:
Only if you need:

White-label licensing to other organizations
Completely different tech stacks per workbook
Independent teams with zero coordination
Vastly different user bases per workbook

Recommended Architecture:
1. Micro-Frontend Pattern Within Single App
Main App Shell
├── Workbook 1 (Mindset) - Lazy loaded
├── Workbook 2 (Debt) - Lazy loaded  
├── Workbook 3 (Investing) - Lazy loaded
├── Dashboard - Always loaded
└── Community - Lazy loaded
2. Feature Flags for Workbook Access
javascriptconst userAccess = {
  workbook1: true,
  workbook2: hasCompletedWorkbook1,
  workbook3: hasCompletedWorkbook2,
  // etc.
}
3. Progressive Enhancement

Start with Workbook 1 fully built
Add subsequent workbooks as modules
Maintain backward compatibility

Business Advantages:
Cross-Workbook Features

Journey timeline showing user's complete transformation
Insights dashboard comparing responses across workbooks
Motivation tracking (seeing progress from Workbook 1 to 6)
Community integration based on overall progress

Monetization Opportunities

Freemium model (Workbook 1 free, others paid)
All-access pass vs individual purchases
Progress-based upsells ("You're 80% through - unlock the next level!")

Bottom Line:
A unified site with modular workbook architecture gives you maximum flexibility while providing the best user experience. You can always extract individual workbooks later if needed, but starting unified allows for much richer features and better user retention.
