✨ PERSONALIZED RESULT MESSAGES
🌱 Seed Planter (Score 0–18)
You’re a Seed Planter.
You’re just beginning to explore your relationship with money — and that takes courage. Maybe you’ve felt confused, overwhelmed, or like you’ve been left out of the wealth-building conversation. That ends now.
You don’t have to figure this out alone. This is the first step to rewriting your money story — with clarity, power, and self-love.
💡 Next Steps:
Start with Workbook 1: Mindset & Awareness to build a solid emotional foundation.
We also recommend:
•	Workbook 2: Debt & Money Clarity
•	Workbook 3: Understanding Assets
•	Workbook 4: Investing Foundations
•	Workbook 6: Financial Independence & Legacy
(Workbook 5: Earning & Income Streams will be added if business interest is shown)
________________________________________
🛠️ Groundbreaker (Score 19–32)
You’re a Groundbreaker.
You’ve started doing the work — learning, reflecting, and becoming more aware. You may not feel “ready,” but you’re open. And that openness is everything.
Now is the time to build real structure around your financial life so you can move from surviving to thriving.
💡 Next Steps:
Start with Workbook 1: Mindset & Awareness
We also recommend:
•	Workbook 2: Debt & Money Clarity
•	Workbook 3: Understanding Assets
•	Workbook 4: Investing Foundations
•	Workbook 6: Financial Independence & Legacy
(Workbook 5 if you showed interest in side income or entrepreneurship)
________________________________________
🛤 Pathwalker (Score 33–44)
You’re a Pathwalker.
You’ve done some real work — and it shows. You’ve made progress with your mindset, your habits, and your financial clarity. But there’s still room to grow, especially in building wealth and creating your bigger vision.
You’re no longer in survival mode. You’re building. Let’s keep that momentum strong.
💡 Next Steps:
Start with Workbook 1 to reconnect to the “why” behind your money.
Then move through:
•	Workbook 3: Understanding Assets
•	Workbook 4: Investing Foundations
•	Workbook 6: Financial Independence & Legacy
•	Workbook 5 if you’re building a side hustle or business
________________________________________
🔮 Oracle (Score 45–52)
You’re an Oracle.
You’ve done the inner work. You’ve taken real action. You’ve moved past excuses, and now you’re playing the long game. You’re not just building wealth — you’re building legacy.
But even the most powerful women need space to reflect, refine, and elevate.
💡 Next Steps:
Use Workbook 1 as a return to center.
Then, step fully into mastery with:
•	Workbook 4: Investing Foundations
•	Workbook 5: Earning & Income Streams (if applicable)
•	Workbook 6: Financial Independence & Legacy
And consider mentoring others in your circle. When one woman rises, we all rise.


💻 Tech Implementation Instructions: Wealth Shift Assessment 
Vision:
This assessment helps women (especially immigrants and beginners) figure out:
1.	Where they are on their financial journey
2.	What their current money mindset is (Fixed / Neutral / Growth)
3.	Which workbooks from The Wealth Shift they should start with
4.	And whether they should be recommended Workbook 5 (business/side income) based on their answers
The experience needs to feel simple, empowering, and uplifting — not like a test, more like an invitation.

✅ What I Need You To Build:
1. Assessment Form
•	Format: 13 multiple-choice questions (provided in CSV).
•	Style: Flow like a personality quiz. Use radio buttons (A–D).
•	Optional: Progress bar or step counter (e.g., “Question 3 of 13”).
2. Scoring Logic
•	Each question has a score (A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4).
•	Total score determines their Wealth Shift Level:
o	0–18 → Seed Planter
o	19–32 → Groundbreaker
o	33–44 → Pathwalker
o	45–52 → Oracle
3. Mindset Label Logic
•	Mindset is based on Q1–Q4:
o	4–8 → Fixed Mindset
o	9–12 → Neutral Mindset
o	13–16 → Growth Mindset
4. Workbook Recommendations
•	Workbook 1 is mandatory for all.
•	Other workbooks recommended based on scores from certain questions (I’ll provide you a logic file).
•	Workbook 5 should only be recommended if:
o	Q12 and Q13 = score 3 or 4 (i.e., selected C or D)
5. Results Display Page
After submission, show:
•	Wealth Shift Level (with name + icon)
•	Mindset Label + short insight
•	Personalized message (I’ll provide these)
•	Workbook recommendations with clickable download links
•	CTA button: “Start Your Shift” or “Download Your First Workbook”
6. Email Integration (Optional but ideal)
•	Automatically email them their result summary and workbook links based on score.
•	Can be connected to Flodesk, Podia, or your backend email provider.
