🌟 THE WEALTH SHIFT WEBSITE BRIEF
⚙️ TECHNICAL STRUCTURE – 
(Final Version with Golden Pass Revision)

🧭 OVERVIEW
The Wealth Shift website will act as the central hub where visitors learn about the brand, explore the experience, and choose their package tier.
Actual checkout, email collection, and product delivery will happen inside StanStore, while FlipSnack hosts and previews all workbook content.
The design must ensure a seamless, single-experience feel—users should not feel like they’re moving between different platforms.

🪙 1. GOLDEN PASS FLOW (Free Starter Kit)
Purpose: Lead magnet & entry into The Wealth Shift ecosystem.
Goal: Collect emails automatically through StanStore and deliver the starter kit immediately.
Step-by-step user flow:
Visitor lands on the Wealth Shift Experience Page on the main site.
At the top of the page, they see the Golden Pass Starter Kit section with:
Visual: Golden door slightly ajar with gold light
Tagline: “Your first step into The Wealth Shift.”
Short persuasion text explaining that to begin, they’ll take the Financial Literacy Test and receive a free 2-day starter kit.
CTA button: [Start Your Journey →]
When clicked, the CTA button redirects to the StanStore “Golden Pass Starter Kit” product page (free).
On StanStore, the user:
Provides their email address to “purchase” the free kit.
Receives an automatic confirmation email from StanStore containing:
FlipSnack links to the 2-day Mindset Reset mini-workbook.
A 2-day bonus mini-workbook (Debt, Investing, or Freedom).
Mini Affirmation & Financial Lingo Deck PDFs.
1 bonus worksheet (“Find Your Investor Type” or “Plan Your Retirement”).
1-month access link to join The Shift Club WhatsApp community.
Optional: link to take the Financial Literacy Test if not completed earlier.
Emails collected through StanStore will automatically populate your Stan email list for future marketing and automation sequences.
Technical details:
Golden Pass product = Free product in StanStore.
StanStore handles email collection and automatic content delivery.
Developer only needs to embed or link the StanStore checkout URL.
Optional: later integrate ConvertKit to sync StanStore emails for long-term automation.



Optional: Workbook Teaser Gallery (below description)
Layout: three horizontally scrolling frames or small thumbnails showing inside pages.
Page 1 → Excerpt from “Day 1 – Money Mindset Reflection”
Page 2 → Excerpt from “The Debt Mirror Exercise”
Page 3 → Excerpt from “Investing Intro Mind Map”
📎 Each thumbnail has a “Peek Inside” button that opens a FlipSnack preview embed in a pop-up modal (use FlipSnack’s preview iframe code).


🧱 Technical Notes for Developer
Embed Structure:
Each package = one reusable component block.
