🧭 Purpose
We want this section to clearly show users the 3-step journey of joining The Wealth Shift, but in a gentler, more empowering tone and design.
Edits to Make — “The Invitation” Section
1. Reword the Headline
Current:
“The Invitation”--- ✨ Welcome to Your Wealth Era
Current:
“This is not just a website—it’s a journey-based conversion funnel, rooted in personal growth and values.”
Reword----The Wealth Shift is your permission slip to grow differently. One bold choice at a time.
✅ Layout Update:
•	Keep the 3 boxes (Assessment, Manifesto, Portal)
•	Re-style them like clean modern cards (see wireframe below)
•	Add step labels ("Step 1", "Step 2", "Step 3")
•	Add line-style icons above each title (can use placeholder emojis for now: 🧠 ✍️ 🔓(feel free to use any cooler images you have)
•	Apply hover effect: glow, shadow, or gentle float
Add a soft section title above:
•	“Your Wealth Shift Starts Here”
Just three simple steps to start shifting how you live, earn, and build wealth.

Edits to Make - "Our Philosophy" Section

🪄 1. Title Update
Current: Our Philosophy- 
Change to:
✨ The Wealth Shift Is Built On
🖼️ Layout
•	Replace the 3 text-based points with 3 clean belief cards, displayed in a row on desktop, stacked on mobile.
•	Each card should have:
o	A large numbered icon at the top (e.g., 1, 2, 3)
o	An icon illustration (e.g., 🌱, 🤝, ✨ – or design-friendly equivalents)
o	A heading + short copy
o	Light border, rounded corners, and hover or entry animation (fade or float)
✍️ Replace current copy with:
________________________________________
Card 1: Intentional Growth
We build wealth from the inside out—grounded in purpose, not pressure.
Card 2: Aligned Community
This space is for women who are ready to be real—with themselves and each other. If you're seeking growth, willing to show up honestly, and craving something deeper—you're home.
Card 3: Transformative Approach
Growth happens at the intersection of challenge and support.
📝 If possible, use the heading:
What We Believe (instead of "Our Philosophy")
 
🧠 3. Quote Card
Current quote:
“Growth happens at the intersection of challenge and support.”
That’s a great quote—but the current "hover to reveal more" interaction is unnecessary. Instead:
•	Put the quote in a soft gold or warm beige highlight block
•	Add attribution if it's your own quote! Or:
“The Wealth Shift was born in that space—between challenge and deep support.”

📣 4. “Ready to Begin?” CTA Section
✅ What’s Working:
•	Strong call to action with “Begin Your Journey”
•	Good structure and focus
•	Clean alignment and hierarchy
