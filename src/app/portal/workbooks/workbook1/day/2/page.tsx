          <p className="mb-4">
            Yesterday, you explored how your mindset shapes your financial life. You uncovered the money beliefs you inherited and began the process of rewriting them with intention. Your past doesn&apos;t define your wealth, your beliefs and actions do.

        <div>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Letting go of a limiting belief is a powerful first step—
            but release without replacement leaves space for doubt to creep back in.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            This is why today&apos;s shift matters.
            It&apos;s not just about deleting the old story—it&apos;s about writing a new one.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            When we&apos;re unlearning, we&apos;re often standing in a void.
            It can feel unfamiliar, even scary.
            You&apos;ve just uprooted something that shaped how you thought, felt, and acted for years.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            But here&apos;s the beautiful truth:
            That space you&apos;ve created? That&apos;s the birthplace of possibility.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            This is your invitation to step into an empowering belief:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-none pl-6 mb-4 space-y-1">
            <li className="flex items-center">
              <span className="text-xl mr-2">✨</span>
              One that makes you feel grounded.
            </li>
            <li className="flex items-center">
              <span className="text-xl mr-2">✨</span>
              One that supports your growth.
            </li>
            <li className="flex items-center">
              <span className="text-xl mr-2">✨</span>
              One that aligns with the future you&apos;re building.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mb-4">
            You don&apos;t have to believe it 100% yet.
            You just have to begin trying it on—like a new outfit.
            Wear it. Walk around in it. Speak it aloud.
            At first, it might feel awkward. But with practice, it becomes your truth.

            Mindset Reminder:
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-4 text-soft-sage">
            Every time you choose a new belief, you&apos;re practicing a growth mindset.
            It&apos;s not just about what you believe—it&apos;s about who you&apos;re becoming through what you believe.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4 text-soft-sage">
            A fixed mindset holds onto fear, guilt, and inherited stories.
            A growth mindset says: &quot;I&apos;m allowed to evolve.&quot;
          </p>
          <p className="text-soft-sage">
            And that&apos;s exactly what you&apos;re doing here.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The process:</h2>
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Identify a belief that supports who you&apos;re becoming (even if it feels like a stretch).</li>
            <li>Write it down. Post it somewhere you&apos;ll see it.</li>
            <li>Say it out loud every morning or every time doubt creeps in.</li>
            <li>Catch yourself when you&apos;re tempted to revert to the old belief—and gently choose again.</li>
          </ol>
          
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The benefit:</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Shifting your belief system is the foundation for every financial and life transformation.
            You move from surviving to building. From reacting to creating. From scarcity to expansion.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            You don&apos;t have to keep believing what you were taught.
            You don&apos;t have to live out your parents&apos; money story.
            You don&apos;t have to carry shame, fear, or silence around money anymore.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            You can choose new beliefs that serve the version of you you&apos;re becoming.

            From My Story:
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            When I let go of the belief that I was doomed to always be behind, I had to fill that space with something new.
            Something that would support the woman I was becoming.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            I didn&apos;t need a perfect plan or instant transformation.
            I just needed a belief that felt possible—and powerful.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            So, I began telling myself:
            &quot;I am building something that matters.&quot;
            &quot;I am learning. I am growing. And I am getting better with money every day.&quot;
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            This belief wasn&apos;t loud, but it was steady.
            And the more I said it, the more I believed it.
          </p>
          <p>
            What about you?
            It doesn&apos;t need to sound impressive to anyone else.
            It just needs to feel good in your body.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">What&apos;s a Money Win You&apos;re Proud Of?</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Let&apos;s be honest—most of us are really good at downplaying our progress.
            We shrug off our small wins. We think, &quot;It&apos;s not a big deal,&quot;
            or &quot;I should be further by now.&quot;
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            But the truth?
            Every shift starts small.
            Every empowered decision you&apos;ve made—no matter how quiet—deserves to be honored.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Maybe you finally said &quot;no&quot; to something that used to throw off your budget.
            Maybe you chose to pause before swiping your card.
            Maybe you opened a savings account, tracked your expenses, or paid more than the minimum… just once.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            None of these actions are small.
            Because behind every one of them is something bigger:

            Why this matters:
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-4 text-soft-sage">
            Wealth doesn&apos;t begin with a bank balance.
            It begins with a decision—then another, and another.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4 text-soft-sage">
            And those decisions stack.
            They build new patterns. They teach your nervous system that you&apos;re safe, capable, and in control.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The process:</h2>
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Look back at the moments you showed up for your money.</li>
            <li>Name it clearly. Describe the moment and how it felt.</li>
            <li>Celebrate it. Literally say to yourself: &quot;I&apos;m proud of this. I did this.&quot;</li>
          </ol>
          <p className="mb-4">
            This isn&apos;t about ego. It&apos;s about building self-trust.
          </p>
          
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The benefit:</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            When you acknowledge your wins—no matter how small—you begin to rewrite your identity.
            You stop seeing yourself as someone who&apos;s &quot;bad with money&quot;…
            …and start becoming the kind of woman who shows up for herself.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            That self-recognition fuels momentum.
            And that momentum?
            It&apos;s what turns a $25 savings win into a $25,000 net worth shift.

          <p className="mb-4">
            When I created my &quot;Pay Yourself First&quot; plan and stuck with it—even for just one month—it changed how I saw myself.
            I remember the first time I followed through with saving at the beginning of the month instead of waiting to see what was left at the end. It felt small. No one knew about it but me. But that moment—it changed everything.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            That quiet, intentional decision became a turning point.
            It wasn&apos;t about the amount—it was about the act.
            It taught me that I could trust myself with money.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            And I didn&apos;t save thousands overnight.
            But I saved something.
            And that &quot;something&quot; became the foundation of a net worth I never imagined I&apos;d build.
